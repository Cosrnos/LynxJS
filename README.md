LynxJS
---
LynxJS is a game engine created with the goal of providing the best experience for the developer possible. We will be using a WebGL renderer with a canvas fallback. At the moment only 2D is supported but we plan to offer a 3D bundle in the future.

## Contributing
LynxJS is currently in development and not meant to be used by anyone other than core developers. However, if you are interested in contributing to the core we'd love to have your submissions!

### Getting started
Simply clone the git repository to your local machine. We use node, grunt and npm to simplify our process. Once you have those installed, run the following command in the main LynxJS folder:

> npm install

Once npm is finished installing our packages, run

> grunt

And you're good to go! Point your browser to http://localhost:8840 to begin development!

### Contributing Code
To contribute code, simply create a pull request or let us know on twitter that you have a patch. We'll review it and let you know if it makes it in!

### Tracker
A [public tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1147134) is available to see what developers are working on.
